 * This repository contains the code, documentation, and slides related to the academic paper.

**Abstract:** This article explores an enhanced Geometric Brownian Motion model for predicting Bitcoin prices, incorporating improvements with drift and seasonality. Historical information is used to calibrate the model, and future price simulations are generated to reflect seasonal patterns. The analysis includes estimating the expected mean price, the range of possible prices, and the 95% confidence interval. This approach provides a more accurate analytical tool for understanding Bitcoinâ€™s volatility and supporting investment decisions in the cryptocurrency market.
